## ARTBAT
This is a simple python script that reads in two text files. The first is a list of numbers. The second is a list of point names. The output is a complete list of each point name for every number. In this example there are 40 numbers. So for each point name there will be 40 unique points, totaling 1280.

## Motivation
I needed to generate 40 names for each point in the list. Instead of doing this manually, which would take a while, I quickly created a python script to do it for me.
